## Laravel Code Re-factor

* I have done the required task that is Re-Factoring the provided code. Due to time factor unable to continue on the writing test-cases.
* In Code Re-Factoring, I tried to covered as much in this time span but I think it can be more optimized and re-factored.
* I did not have the Booking Controller / Booking Repository Jobs scope or internal flow overall, but it seems like the structure and implementation flow seems OK.
* However there were some minor improvements might needed in terms of coding standards and best practices and generating error/success responses.
* So I have tried to modified the API responses (success/error/exceptions) that I feel to meet the standard way to make similar responses. Few key names were modified as well that needs to affected where its required.
* Time Spend: 4 Hours
